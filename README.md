## Deep Learning-Based Forecasting Model Using LSTM for COVID-19 Case Predictions in Malaysia

**Objective:**
This project aims to utilize a deep learning model to forecast daily COVID-19 case numbers in Malaysia, assisting policymakers in deciding when to impose or ease travel restrictions. The project involves developing an Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network model to predict new cases based on the previous 30 days of reported case data.

**#Dataset:**
Trained about 1744 official data provided by Ministry of Health Malaysia in an official GitHub page to forecast Covid-19 cases.

**Deep learning model**

The deep learning model utilized in this project is composed of three main layers: an input layer, an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layer, and an output layer.
